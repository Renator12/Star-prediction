# Star-prediction
Web app using machine learning to predict star type

This web app predicts if a star belongs to the classes of Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants.The user is prompted for the information of Temperature,Luminosity,Radius,Absolute magnitude,Color and spectral type which is fed into a trained randomforest ensemble classifier.The data exploration and ensemble techniques are highlighted in the starpredictor.ipynb google colab and the data is taken from the Star dataset to predict star types from Kaggle.The random forest achieved an F1 score of 1.0 showing perfect prediction in the validation set.However,the dataset was not the largest so there might possible be cases of overfitting in this model.
